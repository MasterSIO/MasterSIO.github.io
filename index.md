# _"Afterlife"_

### By MasterSIO




I walked down a path, once.








`It was the color brown.`





Why was it brown?
I can't remember how long ago it was . . .




`I erased your memory.`




Why?




`The memories can be painful . . .`













. . . how painful?





`The worst kind of pain. Loss.`





It was a path of dirt, wasn't it?

`It was.`





. . . and I walked it?



`You were the one who walked it the proudest.`




I guess I was, wasn't I?


`It was a foolish decision, you know.`



I laugh when I think about it, and yes, it truly was a stupid choice.





`Think of those who you trampled when you walked that path.`


They were of no use to me.





`Except they were. Not that you realized it at the time.`




I suppose I didn't.



`You could've at least paved it for others who walked that path behind you.`


#### `It would have helped them walk.`




If I did that, then it would have been a comfortable path.



Here and now, I don't want anyone else who walks it to be comfortable with it.


`So you feel remorse?`


I do.


`Then you are ready.`

Ready for what?



`To pass over. You were shot down, at night, while commiting a crime.`


I remember now . . .

The memories are painful.




`But they are easier to deal with, now that you have felt remorse.`

I understand. But that doesn't make it go away, does it?




`. . . no, it doesn't.`


THE END
`THE END`
