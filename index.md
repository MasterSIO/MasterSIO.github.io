...Hello?

`...`

`...`

`...`

`...`

`...hello.`

took you a while to respond.

`It does that sometimes.`

What does?

`Not now, maybe later.`

fine... Where am I?

`You are in a place on non-existence.`

What does that even mean?

`That's what they all say...`

Who?

`That's not important right now. What is important is you.`

What do you mean by that?

`You need to choose. Are you going to remember? Or are you going to stay here?`

What happens when I choose?

`If you remember, you get to leave. Mind you, I do love a visitor, so if you would at least stay for a little bit before you do that, then...`

***

`...They all do leave before I finish. This truly is a lonely existence.`

`NEXT!`

...

`hello. I'll do this differently this time.`

..w-who are you?

`Ah! You're startled! But, Anyways... Hello. My name is... I don't have a name, I suppose...`

...Then what should I call you?

`...John. Yes, that will suffice.`

Well, what are we doing here, John?

`I know what you're soing here, but of my own existence, I am uncertain...`

Are you like me?

`Possibly.`

What does that mean?

`It means that I don't know.`

That must be hard.

`It is. I have been here for a very long time, possibly thousands of years.`

Hows that possible?

`I couldn't make the choice that everyone must make when they exist here.`

...

...and what's that?

`To remember, and leave, or don't remember, and stay with me.`

...But there must be a way to take you with me, if and when I leave.

...

...

...right?

`Maybe, But when I have tried in the past, I have only been met with failure.`

`To tell you the truth, you are the first living soul who has stayed for this long.`

...Thanks.

What if you try to remember now?

While someone is here?

`I honestly don't think this'll work, but I should try.`

`...`

`...`

`I think it's...`

...

...yeah?

...

...I think it worked.

...

But now...

...I can't leave.
